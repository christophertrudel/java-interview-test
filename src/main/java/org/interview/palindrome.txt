Add two classes to this package, one Called Palindrome and the other PalindromeAdvanced

The Palindrome class will need to be capable of answering if a string is a palindrome(a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward)
We want the class to be able to answer this question for a word or optionally a phrase and the choice to either be case sensitive or not.

The PalindromeAdvanced class will answer the same thing but will always answer for a word or phrase regardless of its case.
It can also store an array of strings that can be tested to make sure all the strings are words or phrases regardless of its case.
